## What is Life in English?

Life in English is a project that aims to teach English as a foreign language through innovative content and casual conversations.

With our [world-class podcast](https://www.lifeinenglish.net/podcast) and online community, you’ll have everything you need to become proficient in English.

<br>

## Who is it for?

Life in English is for self-taught English learners who are tired of traditional and ineffective methodologies for learning a language. It's for people who are tired of boring grammar lessons and ready to speak with real people.

It doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner or an advanced learner. 

It doesn’t matter if you’re introverted or extroverted. 

As long as you’re truly motivated to learn, willing to respect other members, and follow our rules, you are welcome in this community.
